}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an English musician, composer, record producer, singer, and visual artist, known as one of the principal innovators of [[ambient music]].&lt;ref&gt;[[AllMusic]], Explore Music, &quot;[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d226|pure_url=yes}} Ambient]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Eno was a student of [[Roy Ascott]] on his ''Groundcourse'' at [[Ipswich]] Civic College. He then studied at [[Colchester Institute]] art school in Essex, England, taking inspiration from [[minimalism|minimalist]] painting. During his time on the art course at the Institute, he also gained experience in playing and making music through teaching sessions held in the adjacent music school. He joined the band [[Roxy Music]] as synthesiser player in the early 1970s. Roxy Music's success in the [[glam rock]] scene came quickly, but Eno soon became tired of touring and of conflicts with lead singer [[Bryan Ferry]].

Eno's solo music has explored more [[experimental music]]al styles and ambient music. It has also been immensely influential, pioneering ambient and [[generative music]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ankeny&quot;&gt;Jason Ankeny, [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p74178|pure_url=yes}} ((( Brian Eno &amp;gt; Biography )))], allmusic&lt;/ref&gt; innovating production techniques, and emphasising &quot;theory over practice&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ankeny&quot; /&gt; He also introduced the concept of [[chance music]] to popular audiences, partially through collaborations with other musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Prendergast, Mark ''The Ambient Century'', Bloomsbury UK, 2000. ISBN 0-7475-4213-9&lt;/ref&gt; Eno has also worked as an influential music and album producer. By the end of the 1970s, Eno had worked with [[Robert Fripp]] on the LPs ''[[No Pussyfooting]]'' and ''[[Evening Star (album)|Evening Star]]'', [[David Bowie]] on the seminal &quot;[[Berlin Trilogy]]&quot; and helped popularise the American band [[Devo]] and the punk-influenced &quot;[[No Wave]]&quot; genre. He produced and performed on three albums by [[Talking Heads]], including ''[[Remain in Light]]'' (1980), and produced seven albums for [[U2]], including ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' (1987). Eno has also worked on records by [[James (band)|James]], [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]], [[Coldplay]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Grace Jones]], [[James Blake (musician)|James Blake]] and [[Slowdive]], among others.

Eno pursues multimedia ventures in parallel to his music career, including [[art installation]]s, a regular column on society and innovation in ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine, and &quot;[[Oblique Strategies]]&quot; (written with [[Peter Schmidt (artist)|Peter Schmidt]]), a deck of cards in which cryptic remarks or random insights are intended to resolve dilemmas. Eno continues to collaborate with other musicians, produce records, release his own music, and write.

==Education and early musical career==

Brian Eno was born in 1948 at Phyllis Memorial Hospital, [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]], the son of Catholic parents William Eno, who had followed his father and grandfather into the postal service, and Maria Eno (née Buslot), a Belgian-born woman whom William had met during his World War II service. The unusual surname Eno, long established in Suffolk, derives from the French Huguenot surname Hennot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kindleweb.s3.amazonaws.com/content/B00EBNXLM6/gz_sample.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Maria had already had a daughter (Brian's half-sister Rita), and together William and Maria would have two further children, Arlette and [[Roger Eno|Roger]].

Eno was educated at [[St Joseph's College, Ipswich]], which was founded by the [[Saint Jean-Baptiste de la Salle|St John le Baptiste de la Salle]] order of Catholic brothers (from whom he took part of his name when a student there),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.rs/books?id=nZOGqA7TTN0C&amp;dq=who+I+am+pete&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hin8UebrAYrL4ATC6oCADA&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Who I Am |author=Pete Townshend |publisher=HarperCollins |date= 8 October 2012 |page=100|isbn=978-0-06-212726-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Ipswich Art School in [[Roy Ascott]]'s Groundcourse and the [[Winchester School of Art]], graduating in 1969. At the Winchester School of Art, Eno attended a lecture by [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] about the use of tape machines by non-musicians, citing the lecture as the moment he realised he could make music even though he was not a
musician at that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=e_V-CbIBnMAC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=%22Brian+Peter+George+jean-baptiste+de+la+salle+eno%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Brian%20Peter%20George%20jean-baptiste%20de%20la%20salle%20eno%22&amp;f=false |title=On Some Faraway Beach: The Life and Times of Brian Eno |author=David Sheppard |publisher=Chicago Review Press |date=1 May 2009 |page=27|isbn=9781556529429}}&lt;/ref&gt; In school, he used a [[tape recorder]] as a musical instrument and experimented with his first, sometimes [[improvisation]]al, bands. St. Joseph's College teacher and painter [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]] encouraged him, recalling &quot;Piano Tennis&quot; with Eno, in which, after collecting pianos, they stripped and aligned them in a hall, striking them with tennis balls. From that collaboration, he became involved in [[Cornelius Cardew]]'s [[Scratch Orchestra]]. The first released recording in which Eno played is the [[Deutsche Grammophon]] edition of Cardew's ''The Great Learning'' (rec. Feb. 1971), as one of the voices in the recital of ''The Great Learning'' Paragraph 7. Another early recording was the ''Berlin Horse'' soundtrack, by Malcom Le Grice, a nine-minute, 2 × 16&amp;nbsp;mm-double-projection, released in 1970 and presented in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wkv-stuttgart.de/en/programme/2006/exhibitions/expanded-media/malcolm-le-grice/ |title=Malcom Le Grice Installation |publisher=Wkv-stuttgart.de |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roxy Music==
{{Main|Roxy Music}}

Brian Eno's professional music career began in London, as a member (1971–1973) of the [[glam rock|glam]]/[[art rock]] band [[Roxy Music]], initially not appearing on stage with them at live shows, but operating the [[mixing console|mixing desk]], processing the band's sound with a [[VCS3]] synthesiser and tape recorders, and singing backing vocals. He then progressed to appearing on stage as a performing member of the group, usually flamboyantly costumed. He quit the band on completing the promotion tour for the band's second album, ''[[For Your Pleasure]]'' because of disagreements with lead singer [[Bryan Ferry]] and boredom with the rock star life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/eno%20left%20roxy%20music%20to%20do%20his%20laundry |title=Eno Left Roxy Music to do His Laundry |publisher=Contactmusic.com |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, he described his Roxy Music tenure as important to his career: &quot;As a result of going into a subway station and meeting [saxophonist [[Andy Mackay]]], I joined Roxy Music, and, as a result of that, I have a career in music. If I'd walked ten yards further on the platform, or missed that train, or been in the next carriage, I probably would have been an art teacher now&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prendergast&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Trance: The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age |last=Prendergast |first=Mark |year=2001 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |pages=p118|isbn=1-58234-134-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his period with Roxy Music, and for his first three solo albums, he was credited on these records only as 'Eno'.

==Solo work==

===1970s===
[[File:Brian Eno - TopPop 1974 12.png|thumb|Eno performing on Dutch television in 1974]]
Eno embarked on a solo career almost immediately. Between 1973 and 1977 he created four albums of largely electronically inflected rock and pop songs&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Here Come the Warm Jets]]'', ''[[Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy (album)|Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)]]'', ''[[Another Green World]]'' and ''[[Before and After Science]]'', with [[Phil Collins]] playing drums on some songs, and others in an ambient instrumental style. ''Tiger Mountain'' contains the galloping &quot;Third Uncle&quot;, one of Eno's best-known songs, owing in part to its later being covered by [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]]. Critic Dave Thompson writes that the song is &quot;a near [[punk rock|punk]] attack of riffing guitars and clattering percussion, 'Third Uncle' could, in other hands, be a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] anthem, albeit one whose lyrical content would tongue-tie the most slavish [[air guitar]]ist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Dave |url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t821132|pure_url=yes}} |title=All Music review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These four albums were remastered and reissued in 2004 by [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]'s [[Astralwerks]] label. Due to Eno's decision not to add any extra tracks of the original material, a handful of tracks originally issued as singles have not been reissued (&quot;Seven Deadly Finns&quot; and &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; were included on the deleted Eno Vocal Box set and the single mix of &quot;King's Lead Hat&quot; [the title of which is an [[anagram]] of &quot;[[Talking Heads]]&quot;] has never been reissued).

During this period, Eno also played three dates with [[Phil Manzanera]] in the band [[801 (band)|801]], a &quot;[[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]&quot; that performed more or less mutated selections from albums by Eno, Manzanera, and [[Quiet Sun (band)|Quiet Sun]], as well as covers of songs by [[The Beatles]] and [[The Kinks]].

In 1972, Eno and [[Robert Fripp]] (from [[King Crimson]]) utilised a tape-delay system, described as '[[Frippertronics]]', and the pair released an album in 1973 called ''[[(No Pussyfooting)]].''  The technique involved two Revox tape recorders set up side by side, with the tape unspooling from the first deck being carried over to the second deck to be spooled.  This enabled sound recorded on the first deck to be played back by the second deck at a time delay that varied with the distance between the two decks and the speed of the tape (typically a few seconds). The technique was borrowed from minimalist composer [[Terry Riley]], whose similar tape-delay feedback system with a pair of Revox tape recorders (a setup Riley used to call the &quot;Time Lag Accumulator&quot;) was first used on Riley's album ''Music for The Gift'' in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loopers-delight.com/history/Loophist.html |title=The Birth of Loop |publisher=Loopers-delight.com |date=13 October 1996 |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Fripp and Eno released a second album, ''[[Evening Star (album)|Evening Star]]'', and played several live shows in Europe.

Eno was a prominent member of the performance art-classical orchestra the [[Portsmouth Sinfonia]]&amp;nbsp;– having started playing with them in 1972. In 1973 he produced the orchestra's first album ''The Portsmouth Sinfonia Plays the Popular Classics'' (released in March 1974) and in 1974 he produced the live album ''Hallellujah! The Portsmouth Sinfonia Live at the Royal Albert Hall'' of their infamous May 1974 concert (released in October 1974.) In addition to producing both albums, Eno performed in the orchestra on both recordings&amp;nbsp;– playing the clarinet. Eno also deployed the orchestra's famously dissonant string section on his second solo album ''Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)''. The orchestra at this time included other musicians whose solo work he would subsequently release on his Obscure label including [[Gavin Bryars]] and [[Michael Nyman]]. That year he also composed music for the album ''[[Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy]]'', with [[Kevin Ayers]], to accompany the poet [[Lady June|June Campbell Cramer]].

Eno continued his career by producing a larger number of highly eclectic and increasingly [[ambient music|ambient]] [[electronic music|electronic]] and acoustic albums. He is widely credited with coining the term &quot;ambient music&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Prendergast, ''The Ambient Century'': p.93&lt;/ref&gt; low-volume music designed to modify one's perception of a surrounding environment.

His first such work, 1975's ''[[Discreet Music]]'' (again created via an elaborate tape-delay methodology, which Eno diagrammed on the back cover of the LP ), is considered the landmark album of the genre. This was followed by his ''Ambient'' series (''[[Music for Airports]] (Ambient 1)'', ''[[The Plateaux of Mirror]] (Ambient 2)'', ''[[Day of Radiance]] (Ambient 3)'' and ''[[On Land]] (Ambient 4)''). Eno was the primary musician on these releases with the exception of ''Ambient 2'' which featured [[Harold Budd]] on keyboard, and ''Ambient 3'' where the American composer [[Laraaji]] was the sole musician playing the [[zither]] and [[hammered dulcimer]] with Eno producing.

In 1975 Eno performed as the Wolf in a rock version of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s classic ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''. Produced by [[Robin Lumley]] and [[Jack Lancaster]], the album featured [[Gary Moore]], [[Manfred Mann]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Stephane Grapelli]], [[Chris Spedding]], [[Cozy Powell]], [[Jon Hiseman]], [[Bill Bruford]] and [[Alvin Lee]]. Also in 1975, Eno provided synthesisers and treatments on Quiet Sun's ''[[Mainstream]]'' album alongside [[Phil Manzanera]], [[Charles Hayward (musician)|Charles Hayward]], Dave Jarrett, and [[Bill MacCormick]], and he performed on and contributed songs and vocals to Phil Manzanera's ''[[Diamond Head (album)|Diamond Head]]'' album.

In September 1976 Eno recorded with the [[Krautrock|Krautrock/Kosmische Musik]] group [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia]] at their studio in Forst, Germany. This material was not released until 1997 as ''[[Tracks and Traces]]'' by Harmonia '76.  It was again reissued in 2009 with additional tracks and credited to Harmonia &amp; Eno '76.

===1980s===
In 1980 Eno provided a film score for Herbert Vesely's ''[[Egon Schiele – Exzess und Bestrafung]]'', also known as ''Egon Schiele – Excess and Punishment''. The ambient-style score was an unusual choice for a historical piece, but it worked effectively with the film's themes of sexual obsession and death.

In 1981 having returned from Ghana and before ''On Land'', he discovered [[Miles Davis]]' 1974 track &quot;[[Get Up With It|He Loved Him Madly]]&quot;, a melancholy tribute to Duke Ellington influenced by both African music and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]: as Eno stated in the liner notes for ''On Land'', &quot;[[Teo Macero]]'s revolutionary production on that piece seemed to me to have the &quot;spacious&quot; quality I was after, and like Federico Fellini's 1973 film ''[[Amarcord]]'', it too became a touchstone to which I returned frequently.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/onland-txt.html |title='&amp;#39;Ambient 4: On Land'&amp;#39; 1986 release notes |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980–1981 Eno collaborated with [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] of [[Talking Heads]] (which he had already anagrammatised as 'King's Lead Hat') on [[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'']], which was built around radio broadcasts Eno collected while living in the United States, along with [[sampling (music)|sampling]] recordings from around the world transposed over music predominantly inspired by African and Middle Eastern rhythms.

In 1983 Eno collaborated with his brother, [[Roger Eno]], and [[Daniel Lanois]] on the album &quot;APOLLO: Atmospheres and Soundtracks&quot;.  Many of the sounds created on this album can be heard again on later albums produced by both Eno and Lanois. Tracks from the album are also used as part of the musical score for the Al Reinert film, [[For All Mankind]].

===1990s===
In 1992 Eno released an album featuring heavily syncopated rhythms entitled ''[[Nerve Net (album)|Nerve Net]]'', with contributions from several former collaborators including [[Robert Fripp]], [[Benmont Tench]], [[Robert Quine]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]]. This album was a last-minute substitution for ''My Squelchy Life'', which featured more pop oriented material, with Eno on vocals. (Several tracks from ''My Squelchy Life'' later appeared on 1993's retrospective box set ''Eno Box II: Vocals,'' and the entire album was eventually released in 2014 as part of an expanded rerelease of ''Nerve Net'.'') Eno also released in 1992 a work entitled ''[[The Shutov Assembly]]'', recorded between 1985 and 1990. This album embraces atonality and abandons most conventional concepts of modes, scales and pitch. Much of the music shifts gradually and without discernible focus, and is one of Eno's most varied ambient collections. Conventional instrumentation is eschewed, save for treated keyboards.

During the 1990s Eno became increasingly interested in self-generating musical systems, the results of which he called [[generative music]]. The basic premise of generative music is the blending of several independent musical tracks, of varying sounds, length, and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again mixing with the other tracks allowing the listener to hear an almost infinite combination. In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated that it would take almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. Eno has presented this music in his own, and other artists', art and sound installations, most notably &quot;[[I Dormienti]] (The Sleepers)&quot;, [[Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace]], [[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]], [[The Quiet Room]] and &quot;Music for Prague&quot;.

One of Eno's better-known collaborations was with the members of U2, Luciano Pavarotti and several other artists in a group called Passengers.  They produced the 1995 album &quot;Original Soundtracks 1&quot;.  This album reached No. 76 on the US Billboard charts and No. 12 in the UK charts.  It featured a single, &quot;Miss Sarajevo&quot;, which was a top 10 hit in the UK (#6).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
This collaboration is chronicled in Eno's book ''[[A Year with Swollen Appendices]]'' a diary published in 1996.

In 1996 Eno scored the six-part fantasy television series ''[[Neverwhere]]''.

===2000s===
In 2004 Fripp and Eno recorded another [[Ambient music|ambient]] collaboration album, ''[[The Equatorial Stars]]''.

Eno returned in June 2005 with ''[[Another Day on Earth]]'', his first major album since ''[[Wrong Way Up]]'' (with John Cale) to prominently feature vocals (a trend continued with ''[[Everything That Happens Will Happen Today]]''). The album differs from his 1970s solo work as musical production has changed since then, evident in its semi-electronic production.

In early 2006 Eno collaborated with David Byrne, again, for the reissue of ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' in celebration of the influential album's 25th anniversary. Eight previously unreleased tracks, recorded during the initial sessions in 1980/81, were added to the album, while one track, &quot;Qu'ran&quot;, was removed in accordance with a strongly worded complaint from an Islamic organisation in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An unusual interactive marketing strategy coincided with its re-release, the album's promotional website features the ability for anyone to officially and legally download the multi-tracks of two songs from the album, &quot;A Secret Life&quot; and &quot;Help Me Somebody&quot;. Individuals can then remix and upload new mixes of these tracks to the website so others can listen to and rate them.

[[File:Brian Eno Profile Long Now Foundation 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Eno at [[The Long Now Foundation]], 26 June 2006]]
In late 2006 Eno released ''[[77&amp;nbsp;Million Paintings]]'', a program of generative video and music specifically for the [[Personal computer|PC]]. As its title suggests, there is a possible combination of 77&amp;nbsp;million paintings where the viewer will see different combinations of video slides prepared by Eno each time the program is launched. Likewise, the accompanying music is generated by the program so that it's almost certain the listener will never quite hear the same arrangement twice. The second edition of &quot;77&amp;nbsp;Million Paintings&quot; featuring improved morphing and a further two layers of sound was released on 14 January 2008. In June 2007, when commissioned in the Yerba Buena Center of the Arts in San Francisco, California, [[Annabeth Robinson]] (AngryBeth Shortbread) recreated ''77 Million Paintings'' in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Author|first=Unknown|title=77-million-paintings-brian-eno|url=http://longnow.org/events/02007/jun/29/77-million-paintings-brian-eno/|work=77 Million Paintings|publisher=The Long Now Foundation|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Eno's music was featured in a [[Ecstasy (2007 film)|movie adaption]] of [[Irvine Welsh]]'s best-selling collection ''[[Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance]]''. He also appeared playing keyboards in ''[[Voila (album)|Voila]]'', [[Belinda Carlisle]]'s solo album sung entirely in French.

Also in 2007, Eno contributed a composition titled &quot;Grafton Street&quot; to [[Dido (singer)|Dido's]] third album, ''[[Safe Trip Home]]'', released in November 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;qmag&quot;&gt;Aizlewood, John. [http://img4web.com/b/XCMDC &quot;In The Studio&quot;]. ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]''. October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he released ''[[Everything That Happens Will Happen Today]]'' with David Byrne, designed the sound for the video game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' and wrote a chapter to ''Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture'', edited by Paul D. Miller (a.k.a. [[DJ Spooky]]).

Eno revealed on radio in May 2009 that a skin graft he received as treatment for a severe burn on his arm was part human skin, part [[carbon fibre]]. He explained that as human skin is based on [[carbon]], the experimental treatment was likely going to work out well for him, in spite of the fact that he feels a lightness in the affected arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.surgfm.org/?page_id=178 |title=Interview with Sydney University Radio Group, 18&amp;nbsp;May 2009 |publisher=News.surgfm.org |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009 Eno curated the Luminous Festival at [[Sydney Opera House]], culminating in his first live appearance in many years. &quot;Pure Scenius&quot; consisted of three live improvised performances on the same day, featuring Eno, Australian improvisation trio [[The Necks]], Karl Hyde from [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]], electronic artist [[Jon Hopkins]] and guitarist [[Leo Abrahams]].

Eno scored the music for [[Peter Jackson]]'s film adaptation of ''[[The Lovely Bones (film)|The Lovely Bones]]'', released in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brian Eno: The Lovely Bones  |url=http://upcomingfilmscores.blogspot.com/2008/12/brian-eno-lovely-bones.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Eno released ''[[Lux (album)|Lux]]'', a 76-minute composition in four sections, via Warp Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Carrie Battanon |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/47996-brian-eno-plans-solo-record-for-november/ |title=Brian Eno Plans Solo Record for November |publisher=pitchfork |date=26 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eno worked with [[France|French]]–[[Algeria]]n [[Raï]] singer [[Rachid Taha]] on Taha’s  ''[[Tékitoi]]'' (2004) and ''[[Zoom (Rachid Taha album)|Zoom]]'' (2013) albums, contributing percussion, bass, brass and vocals. Eno also performed with Taha at the Stop the War concert in London in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qmyiR9iNyM |title=Rachid Taha - ''Rock El Casbah'' feat.

In May 2014, Eno and Underworld's Karl Hyde released ''[[Someday World]]'', featuring various guest musicians: from Coldplay's Will Champion and Roxy Music's Andy Mackay to newer names such as 22 year old Fred Gibson, who helped produce the record with Eno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/apr/29/brian-eno-and-karl-hyde-someday-world-exclusive-album-stream |title=Brian Eno and Karl Hyde – Someday World: exclusive album stream |publisher=Guardian.com |date= 29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within weeks of the release, a second full length was announced titled '[[High Life (Eno and Hyde album)|High Life]]', which was released on the 30th of June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henry|first=Dusty|title=&quot;Brian Eno and Karl Hyde announce new album, High Life, stream &quot;DBF&quot;&quot;|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/05/brian-eno-and-karl-hyde-announce-new-album-high-life-stream-dbf/|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Record producer and other projects==

===Record production===
From the beginning of his solo career in 1973, Eno was in demand as a producer&amp;nbsp;– though his management now describe him as a &quot;sonic landscaper&quot; rather than a producer. The first album with Eno credited as producer was ''[[Lucky Leif and the Longships]]'' by [[Robert Calvert]]. Eno's lengthy string of producer credits includes albums for [[Talking Heads]], [[U2]], [[Devo]], [[Ultravox]] and [[James (band)|James]]. He also produced part of the 1993 album ''[[When I Was a Boy]]'' by [[Jane Siberry]]. He won the best producer award at the 1994 and 1996 [[BRIT Awards]].

Eno describes himself as a &quot;non-musician&quot; and coined the term &quot;treatments&quot; to describe his modification of the sound of musical instruments, and to separate his role from that of the traditional instrumentalist. His skill at using &quot;The Studio as a Compositional Tool&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/downbeat79.htm |title=Pro Session&amp;nbsp;– The Studio as Compositional Tool |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the title of an essay by Eno) led in part to his career as a producer. His methods were recognised at the time (mid-1970s) as unique, so much so that on [[Genesis (band)|Genesis's]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', he is credited with 'Enossification'; on [[Robert Wyatt]]'s ''[[Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard]]'' with a ''Direct inject anti-jazz raygun'' and on [[John Cale]]'s [[Island Records|Island]] albums as simply being &quot;Eno&quot;.

Despite being a self-professed &quot;non-musician&quot;, Eno has contributed to recordings by artists as varied as [[Nico]], [[Robert Calvert]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Zvuki Mu]], in various capacities such as use of his studio/synthesiser/electronic treatments, vocals, guitar, bass guitar, and as just being 'Eno'. In 1984, he (along with several other authors) composed and performed the &quot;Prophecy Theme&quot; for the [[David Lynch]] film ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]''; the rest of the [[Dune (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] was composed and performed by the group [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. Eno produced performance artist [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]]'s ''[[Bright Red]]'' album, and also composed for it. The work is avant-garde spoken word with haunting and magnifying sounds. Eno played on David Byrne's musical score for ''The Catherine Wheel'', a project commissioned by [[Twyla Tharp]] to accompany her Broadway dance project of the same name.

He worked with [[David Bowie]] as a writer and musician on Bowie's influential 1977–79 '[[Berlin Trilogy]]' of albums, ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]], [[&quot;Heroes&quot;]]'' and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'', on Bowie's later album ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]]'', and on the song &quot;[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]&quot;. In 1980 Eno developed an interest in altered guitar tunings, which led to [[Guitarchitecture]] discussions with [[Chuck Hammer]], former [[Lou Reed]] guitarist.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A new collaboration between David Byrne and Brian Eno titled ''[[Everything That Happens Will Happen Today]]'' was released digitally on 18 August 2008, with the enhanced CD released in October.

Eno co-produced ''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]'' (1984), ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' (1987), ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' (1991), and ''[[All That You Can't Leave Behind]]'' (2000) for U2 with his frequent collaborator [[Daniel Lanois]], and produced 1993's ''[[Zooropa]]'' with [[Flood (producer)|Mark &quot;Flood&quot; Ellis]]. In 1995, U2 and Eno joined forces to create the album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]'' under the group name Passengers; songs from ''OST1'' included &quot;[[Your Blue Room]]&quot; and &quot;[[Miss Sarajevo]]&quot;. When the album was released, the US charts were dominated by movie soundtrack albums and singles. Even though films are listed for each song, all but three are bogus. Once Eno pointed out that it was not a real ploy for radio airplay, but a spoof of one, U2 agreed to the concept. Eno also produced ''[[Laid]]'' (1993), ''[[Wah Wah]]'' (1994) ''[[Millionaires (album)|Millionaires]]'' (1999) and ''[[Pleased to Meet You (James album)|Pleased to Meet You]]'' (2001) for [[James (band)|James]], performing as an extra musician on all four. He is credited for &quot;frequent interference and occasional co-production&quot; on their 1997 album ''[[Whiplash (album)|Whiplash]]''.

Eno played on the 1986 album ''[[Measure for Measure (album)|Measure for Measure]]'' by Australian band [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]]. He remixed two tracks for [[Depeche Mode]], &quot;[[I Feel You]]&quot; and &quot;[[In Your Room (Depeche Mode song)|In Your Room]]&quot;, both single releases from the album ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'' in 1993. In 1995, Eno provided one of several remixes of &quot;[[Protection (Massive Attack song)|Protection]]&quot; by [[Massive Attack]] (originally from their ''[[Protection (album)|Protection]]'' album) for release as a single. The single also included more remixes by DJs [[J-Swift]], Tom D, and Underdog.

In 2007, he produced the fourth studio album by [[Coldplay]] entitled ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'', which was released in 2008. Also in 2008, he worked with [[Grace Jones]] on her album ''[[Hurricane (Grace Jones album)|Hurricane]]'', credited for &quot;production consultation&quot; and as a member of the band, playing keyboards, treatments and background vocals. He worked on the twelfth studio album by [[U2]], again with Lanois, titled ''[[No Line on the Horizon]]''. It was recorded in Morocco, South France and [[Dublin]] and released in Europe on 27 February 2009.

In 2011, Eno and Coldplay reunited and Eno contributed &quot;enoxification&quot; and additional composition on Coldplay's fifth studio album ''[[Mylo Xyloto]]'', released on 24 October of that year.

===The Microsoft Sound===
In 1994, [[Microsoft]] corporation designers [[Mark Malamud]] and [[Erik Gavriluk]] approached Brian Eno to compose music for the [[Windows 95]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/intel-microsoft-research-in-motion-apple/5/25/2010/id/28465?refresh=1|title=Who Created The Windows Start-Up Sound?|last=Rohrlich|first=Justin|date=25 May 2010|work=[[Minyanville]]'s Wall Street|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the six-second start-up music-sound of the Windows 95 operating system, &quot;The Microsoft Sound&quot;. In an interview with [[Joel Selvin]] in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' he said:

{{quote|The idea came up at the time when I was completely bereft of ideas. I'd been working on my own music for a while and was quite lost, actually. And I really appreciated someone coming along and saying, &quot;Here's a specific problem – solve it.&quot;

The thing from the agency said, &quot;We want a piece of music that is inspiring, universal, blah-blah, da-da-da, optimistic, futuristic, sentimental, emotional,&quot; this whole list of adjectives, and then at the bottom it said &quot;and it must be 3&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; seconds long.&quot;&lt;ref group=&quot;†&quot; name=&quot;MSSound&quot;&gt;The eventual length of The Microsoft Sound as supplied and used was roughly 6 seconds, not 3&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

I thought this was so funny and an amazing thought to actually try to make a little piece of music. It's like making a tiny little jewel.

In fact, I made eighty-four pieces. I got completely into this world of tiny, tiny little pieces of music. I was so sensitive to microseconds at the end of this that it really broke a logjam in my own work. Then when I'd finished that and I went back to working with pieces that were like three minutes long, it seemed like oceans of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=[[Joel Selvin]], Chronicle Pop Music Critic |url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Q-and-A-With-Brian-Eno-2979740.php |title=Q and A With Brian Eno |work=San Francisco Chronicle  |date=2 June 1996 |accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eno shed further light on the composition of the sound on the [[BBC Radio 4]] show ''[[The Museum of Curiosity]]'', admitting that he created it using a [[Macintosh]] computer, and stating &quot;I wrote it on a Mac. I've never used a [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] in my life; I don't like them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Adam Bunker, Technology Journalist|url=http://www.electricpig.co.uk/2011/11/23/brian-eno-spills-windows-start-up-sound-secrets/ |title=Brian Eno spills Windows start-up sound secrets |work=Electricpig  |date=23 November 2011 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video work===
Eno had spoken of an early and ongoing interest in playing with light in a similar way to the ambient manner in which he manipulated sound, but only started experimenting with the medium of video in 1978. Eno describes the first video camera he received, which would become his main tool for creating ambient video and light installations:

&quot;One afternoon while I was working in the studio with [[Talking Heads]], the roadie from [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], working in an adjacent studio, came in and asked whether anyone wanted to buy some video equipment. I'd never really thought much about video, and found most 'video art' completely unmemorable, but the prospect of actually owning a video camera was at that time quite exotic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eno, Brian (2006). ''77 Million Paintings'' &quot;My Light Years&quot;. pp. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Panasonic]] industrial camera Eno received had significant [[design flaws]] preventing the camera from sitting upright without the assistance of a tripod. This led to his works' being filmed in vertical format, forcing the viewer to flip his television set on its side to view it in the proper orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Eno, Brian (2006). &quot;My Light Years&quot;. pp. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces Eno produced with this method, such as ''Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan'' (1980) and ''[[Thursday Afternoon]]'' (1984) (accompanied by the album of the same title), were labelled as 'Video Paintings.' He explained the genre title in the music magazine NME:

&quot;I was delighted to find this other way of using video because at last here's video which draws from another source, which is painting… I call them 'video paintings' because if you say to people 'I make videos', they think of Sting's new rock video or some really boring, grimy 'Video Art'. It's just a way of saying, 'I make videos that don't move very fast.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/nme85.html#Thursday |title=NME: Proxy Music |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |date=9 November 1985 |accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These works presented Eno with the opportunity to expand his ambient aesthetic into a visual form, manipulating the medium of video to produce something not present in the normal television experience. His video works were shown around the world in exhibitions in New York and Tokyo, as well as released on the compilation 14 Video Paintings in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Eno, Brian (2006). &quot;My Light Years&quot;. pp. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eno continued his video experimentation through the 80s, 90s and 2000s, leading to further experimentation with the television as a malleable light source and onto his generative works such as 77 Million Paintings in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Eno, Brian (2006). &quot;My Light Years&quot;. pp. 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generative music===
In 1996 he collaborated in developing the SSEYO [[Koan (program)|Koan]] [[generative music]] system (by Pete Cole and Tim Cole of [http://www.intermorphic.com intermorphic]) that he used in composing the hybrid music in the album ''Generative Music 1''.

In 2006 the software program ''[[77 Million Paintings]]'' was developed and released for both Windows and Macintosh operating systems. The program displays artwork, full screen, by Eno while his music plays. The randomized combinations generated by the software of both the overlaid image slideshow and the music layers effectively ensures that the same combination of image and soundscape is never played twice. A second edition of ''77 Million Paintings'', featuring improved image morphing and a further two layers of sound, was released on the 14 January 2008.

Brian Eno with [[Peter Chilvers (musician)|Peter Chilvers]] set up the website [http://www.generativemusic.com/ generativemusic.com] and created generative music applications for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad: ''[[Bloom (software)|Bloom]]'' (2008), ''Trope'' (2009), ''Scape'' (2012) - and Sandra O’Neill &amp; Peter Chilvers created ''Air'' (2009), based on concepts developed by Eno in his 'Ambient 1: Music for Airports' album.

Eno has also participated, as composer, with Peter Chilvers, as consultant, in the creation of the score for the video game ''[[Spore (2008 video_game)|Spore]]'' (2008) by Electronic Arts (of ''Sims'' fame) - in which much of the music is presented in a generative manner - most notably during the cell game, and while player visits a planet. As well, generative music is featured for each of the game's editors/creators, where a player can create or edit cells, creatures, buildings, vehicles, spaceships and more (for use in game play). While a good deal of the game's soundtrack is generative other methods are used, such as straight looping.

===Obscure Records===
{{Main|Obscure Records}}

Eno started the Obscure Records label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The first group of three releases included his own composition, ''[[Discreet Music]]'', and the now-famous ''The Sinking of the Titanic'' (1969) and ''[[Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet]]'' (1971) by [[Gavin Bryars]]. The second side of ''Discreet Music'' consisted of several versions of [[Canon in D|Pachelbel's Canon]], the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage, to which various algorithmic transformations have been applied, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a [[tape loop]] system for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds in some of his collaborations with Fripp, most notably on ''[[Evening Star (album)|Evening Star]]''. Only 10 albums were released on Obscure, including works by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Michael Nyman]], and [[John Cage]]. At this time Eno was also affiliating with artists in the [[Fluxus|Fluxus movement]].

===Other work===
Eno has also been active in other artistic fields.  In March 2008 Eno collaborated with the Italian artist [[Mimmo Paladino]] on a show of the latter's works with Eno's soundscapes at Ara Pacis in Rome. In 2008, Eno designed the procedurally-generated music for the video game [[Spore (2008 video game)|''Spore'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/spore/907564p2.html |title=GameSpy: Spore&amp;nbsp;– Page 2 |publisher=Pc.gamespy.com |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, Eno collaborated with [[Peter Chilvers (musician)|Peter Chilvers]] to create an application titled [[Bloom (software)|Bloom]], Trope, and Air for the [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/10/review-brian-en.html |title=Eno and Chilvers Release Sweet Music App for iPhone &amp;#124; Listening Post |publisher=Blog.wired.com |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Brian Eno made a number of limited edition prints featuring the artwork from his 2012 album [[Lux]] available only from his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/nov/27/brian-eno-curate-brighton-festival |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=Brian Eno to curate Brighton festival | first=Charlotte | last=Higgins | date=27 November 2009 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As for a philosophical analysis of Lux, vid.

==Influence==
Eno is frequently referred to as one of popular music's most influential artists.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Roberts, [http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/brian-eno-lecture-csulb-77-mil/ &quot;Brian Eno to Lecture CSU-Long Beach, Present 77&amp;nbsp;Million Paintings, Blow Our Minds&quot;], ''LA Weekly'', 30 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Jason Ankeny at [[Allmusic]] argues that Eno &quot;forever altered the ways in which music is approached, composed, performed, and perceived, and everything from punk to techno to new age bears his unmistakable influence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ankeny&quot; /&gt; He has spread his techniques and theories primarily through his production; his distinctive style affected a number of projects he's been involved in, including Bowie's [[Berlin Trilogy]] (helping to popularise [[minimalism (music)|minimalism]]) and the albums he produced for [[Talking Heads]] (incorporating [[African music]] and polyrhythms on Eno's advice), [[Devo]], and other groups.&lt;ref&gt;''Musician Guide'', [http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004151/Brian-Eno.html &quot;Brian Eno Biography&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Eno's first collaboration with [[David Byrne]], 1981's ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]'', pioneered [[music sampling|sampling]] techniques that would prove to be influential in hip-hop, and broke ground by incorporating [[world music]].&lt;ref&gt;Gina Vivinetto, [http://www.sptimes.com/2004/07/01/Floridian/Reasons_to_know_Brian.shtml &quot;Reasons to know Brian Eno&quot;], ''SP Times'', 1 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Eno and [[Peter Schmidt (artist)|Peter Schmidt]]'s [[Oblique Strategies]] have been utilised by many bands, and Eno's production style has proven influential in several general respects: &quot;his recording techniques have helped change the way that modern musicians&amp;nbsp;– particularly electronic musicians&amp;nbsp;– view the studio. No longer is it just a passive medium through which they communicate their ideas but itself a new instrument with seemingly endless possibilities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ambientguide&quot;&gt;Ambient Music Guide, [http://www.ambientmusicguide.com/pages/E/enoBrian.php &quot;Brian Eno&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

While not the only inventor of [[ambient music]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson&quot;&gt;Richardson, Mark. [http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7875-brian-eno/ &quot;Pitchfork: Interviews: Brian Eno&quot;]. Pitchfork Media. pitchfork.com. 1 November 2010. Retrieved 9 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Eno is seen as a major contributor to the genre. The Ambient Music Guide argues that he has brought from &quot;relative obscurity into the popular consciousness&quot; fundamental ideas about ambient music, including &quot;the idea of modern music as subtle atmosphere, as chill-out, as impressionistic, as something that creates space for quiet reflection or relaxation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ambientguide&quot; /&gt; His groundbreaking work in [[electronic music]] has been said to have brought widespread attention to and innovations in the role of electronic technology in recording.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson&quot; /&gt;

&quot;I've often eulogised Eno's musical abilities,&quot; remarked [[Richard Wright (musician)|Rick Wright]] of [[Pink Floyd]], &quot;but alongside his talent he's also a very nice guy. Sickening, isn't it?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', November 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Half Man Half Biscuit]] (in the song &quot;Eno Collaboration&quot; on the EP of the [[Eno Collaboration|same name]]) and [[MGMT]] have written songs about Eno. The band [[LCD Soundsystem]] has frequently cited Eno as a key influence on their own sound and music. In 2011 [[Belgian people|Belgian]] academics from the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]] named a species of [[List of Corinnidae species|Afrotropical spider]] ''Pseudocorinna brianeno'' in his honour.&lt;ref name=&quot;spidername&quot;&gt;Rudy Jocque &amp; Jan Bosselaers, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1096-3642.2010.00679.x/abstract &quot;Revision of Pseudocorinna Simon and a new related genus (Araneae: Corinnidae): two more examples of spider templates with a large range of complexity in the genitalia&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
